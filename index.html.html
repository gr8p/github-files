    Privacy Policy Agreement March 9, 2021 Event App (Gr8p App) values its
    users’ privacy. This Privacy Policy (“Policy”) will help you understand how
    we collect and use personal information from those who visit our website or
    make use of our online facilities and services, and what we will and will
    not do with the information we collect. Our Policy has been designed and
    created to ensure those affiliated with Event App of our commitment and
    realization of our obligation not only to meet, but to exceed, most existing
    privacy standards. We reserve the right to make changes to this Policy at
    any given time. If you want to make sure that you are up to date with the
    latest changes, we advise you to frequently visit this page. If at any point
    in time Event App decides to make use of any personally identifiable
    information on file, in a manner vastly different from that which was stated
    when this information was initially collected, the user or users shall be
    promptly notified by email. Users at that time shall have the option as to
    whether to permit the use of their information in this separate manner. This
    Policy applies to Event App, and it governs any and all data collection and
    usage by us. Through the use of www.gr8p.github.io, you are therefore
    consenting to the data collection procedures expressed in this Policy.
    Please note that this Policy does not govern the collection and use of
    information by companies that Event App does not control, nor by individuals
    not employed by us. If you visit a website that we mention or link to, be
    sure to review its privacy policy before providing the site with
    information. It is highly recommended and suggested that you review the
    privacy policies and statements of any website you choose to use or frequent
    to better understand the way in which websites garner, make use of and share
    the information collected. Specifically, this Policy will inform you of the
    following 1. What personally identifiable information is collected from you
    through our website; 2. Why we collect personally identifiable information
    and the legal basis for such collection; 3. How we use the collected
    information and with whom it may be shared; 4. What choices are available to
    you regarding the use of your data; and 5. The security procedures in place
    to protect the misuse of your information. Information We Collect It is
    always up to you whether to disclose personally identifiable information to
    us, although if you elect not to do so, we reserve the right not to register
    you as a user or provide you with any products or services. In addition,
    Event App may have the occasion to collect non-personal anonymous
    demographic information, such as age, gender, household income, political
    affiliation, race and religion, as well as the type of browser you are
    using, IP address, or type of operation system, which will assist us in
    providing and maintaining superior quality service. Why We Collect
    Information and For How Long We are collecting your data for several
    reasons: • To better understand your needs and provide you with the services
    you have requested; • To fulfill our legitimate interest in improving our
    services and products; • To send you promotional emails containing
    information we think you may like when we have your consent to do so; • To
    contact you to fill out surveys or participate in other types of market
    research, when we have your consent to do so; • To customize our website
    according to your online behavior and personal preferences. The data we
    collect from you will be stored for no longer than necessary. The length of
    time we retain said information will be determined based upon the following
    criteria: the length of time your personal information remains relevant; the
    length of time it is reasonable to keep records to demonstrate that we have
    fulfilled our duties and obligations; any limitation periods within which
    claims might be made; any retention periods prescribed by law or recommended
    by regulators, professional bodies or associations; the type of contract we
    have with you, the existence of your consent, and our legitimate interest in
    keeping such information as stated in this Policy. Use of Information
    Collected Event App does not now, nor will it in the future, sell, rent, or
    lease any of its customer lists and/or names to any third parties. Event App
    may collect and may make use of personal information to assist in the
    operation of our website and to ensure delivery of the services you need and
    request. At times, we may find it necessary to use personally identifiable
    information as a means to keep you informed of other possible products
    and/or services that may be available to you from www.gr8p.github.io. Event
    App may also be in contact with you with regards to completing surveys
    and/or research questionnaires related to your opinion of current or
    potential future services that may be offered. Disclosure of Information
    Event App may not use or disclose the information provided by you except
    under the following circumstances: • As necessary to provide services or
    products you have ordered; • In other ways described in this Policy or to
    which you have otherwise consented.; • In the aggregate with other
    information in such a way so that your identity cannot reasonably be
    determined; • As required by law, or in response to a subpoena or search
    warrant; • To outside auditors who have agreed to keep the information
    confidential; • As necessary to enforce the Terms of Service; • As necessary
    to maintain, safeguard and preserve all the rights and property of Event
    App. Non-Marketing Purposes Event App greatly respects your privacy. We do
    maintain and reserve the right to contact you if needed for non-marketing
    purposes (such as bug alerts, security breaches, account issues, and/or
    changes in Event App products and services). In certain circumstances, we
    may use our app, newspaper, or other public means to post a notice. Children
    under the age of 13 Event App’s app is not directed to, and does not
    knowingly collect personal identifiable information from, children under the
    age of thirteen (13). If it is determined that such information has been
    inadvertently collected on anyone under the age of thirteen (13), we shall
    immediately take the necessary steps to ensure that such information is
    deleted from our system’s database, or in the alternative, that verifiable
    parental consent is obtained for the use and storage of such information.
    Anyone under the age of thirteen (13) must seek and obtain parent or
    guardian permission to use this website. Unsubscribe or Opt-Out All users
    and visitors to our website have the option to discontinue receiving
    communications from us by way of email or newsletters. To discontinue or
    unsubscribe from our app please delete your account. If you wish to
    unsubscribe or opt-out from any third-party websites, you must go to that
    specific website to unsubscribe or opt-out. Event App will continue to
    adhere to this Policy with respect to any personal information previously
    collected. Links to Other Websites Our website does contain links to
    affiliate and other websites. Event App does not claim nor accept
    responsibility for any privacy policies, practices and/or procedures of
    other such websites. Therefore, we encourage all users and visitors to be
    aware when they leave our website and to read the privacy statements of
    every website that collects personally identifiable information. This
    Privacy Policy Agreement applies only and solely to the information
    collected by our website. Notice to European Union Users Event App’s
    operations are located primarily in the United States. If you provide
    information to us, the information will be transferred out of the European
    Union (EU) and sent to the United States. (The adequacy decision on the
    EU-US Privacy became operational on August 1, 2015. This framework protects
    the fundamental rights of anyone in the EU whose personal data is
    transferred to the United States for commercial purposes. It allows the free
    transfer of data to companies that are certified in the US under the Privacy
    Shield.) By providing personal information to us, you are consenting to its
    storage and use as described in this Policy. Security Event App takes
    precautions to protect your information. When you submit sensitive
    information via the website, your information is protected both online and
    offline. Wherever we collect sensitive information (e.g. credit card
    information), that information is encrypted and transmitted to us in a
    secure way. You can verify this by looking for a lock icon in the address
    bar and looking for “https” at the beginning of the address of the webpage.
    While we use encryption to protect sensitive information transmitted online,
    we also protect your information offline. Only employees who need the
    information to perform a specific job (for example, billing, or customer
    service) are granted access to personally identifiable information. The
    computers and servers in which we store personally identifiable information
    are kept in a secure environment. This is all done to prevent any loss,
    misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure or modification of the user’s
    personal information under our control. Acceptance of Terms By using this
    app, you are hereby accepting the terms and conditions stipulated within the
    Privacy Policy Agreement. If you are not in agreement with our terms and
    conditions, then you should refrain from further use of our sites. In
    addition, your continued use of our app following the posting of any updates
    or changes to our terms and conditions shall mean that you agree and
    acceptance of such changes. How to Contact Us If you have any questions or
    concerns regarding the Privacy Policy Agreement related to our app, please
